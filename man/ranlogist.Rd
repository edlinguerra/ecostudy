\usage{
ranlogist(N0, b, d, K, bcontr=0.5)
\method{plot}{ranlogist}(x, ...)
\method{lines}{ranlogist}(x, ...)
\method{traj}{ranlogist}(x, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{N0}{Initial population size }
  \item{b}{Birth rate. }
  \item{d}{Death rate. }
  \item{K}{Carrying capacity. }
  \item{bcontr}{The proportion of decrease of growth rate due to
    decrease in the birth rate. }

  \item{\dots}{Other parameters passed to graphical functions.}

\details{

  The stochastic population growth rate is based on logistic
  expectation following Pielou (1969). The instantaneous growth rate
  is the difference of birth and death rates \eqn{r = b - d}.  The
  birth and death rates are dependent on current population size and
  at carrying capacity \eqn{K} they are equal (\eqn{r = b}). The sum
  of death and birth rates at given population size gives the current
  event rate which is used to simulate the time to the next event from
  exponential distribution.  The next event is either (1) a birth that
  increases population size by one or (2) a death that reduces
  population size by one individual. Consequently, the population size
  is discrete (integer) but time is continuous, unlike in many other
  stochastic models which treat time as discrete, but population size
  as continuous.  Further, Pielou's model has real temporal
  autocorrelation of population size, unlike many other models which
  vary expected population growth with no autocorrelation.

  Krebs (2009, p. 155) discusses Pielou (1969) briefly, but ignores
  the advanced features of her model.

  Function \code{ranlogist} perform the simulation, \code{traj}
  extracts the simulation results, and \code{plot} and \code{lines}
  can be used for graphics.  The \code{plot} is based on
  \code{\link{plot.traj}}.

\value{
  Function \code{ranlogist} returns the model parameters, \eqn{r},
  targeted end time of simulation (\code{timend}) and the simulation
  results in vectors \code{time} and \code{N}, and the function
  \code{call}.
