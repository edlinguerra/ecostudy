}
\usage{data(lynxhare)}
\format{
  A data frame with 91 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{Year}}{Trading year.}
    \item{\code{Hare}}{Number of snowshoe hare pelts (thousands).}
    \item{\code{Lynx}}{Number of lynx pelts (thousands).}
  }
}
\details{
  These data are regularly used to demonstrate predator--prey
  cycles. However, the species are a part of more complex ecosystem
  (including plant--hare) and collected from various areas, and are
  hardly a demonstration of a predator--prey cycle alone.

  The lynx data for the MacKenzie River area are provided in the
  standard \R dataset \code{\link{lynx}}, whereas the current data
  covers all Hudson Bay areas in Northern America. The dataset is a
  data frame that also inherits from class \code{"traj"} so that
  \code{\link{plot.traj}} can be used to display its results.
